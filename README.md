Wazuh SIEM/XDR Authentication Failure Analysis
Overview

This lab focused on analyzing repeated authentication failures within a Wazuh SIEM/XDR environment and determining when alert activity transitioned from a false positive to a true positive. Rather than treating alerts in isolation, the investigation emphasized correlation, frequency analysis, and contextual awareness to mirror real-world SOC workflows.

The goal was to assess whether authentication failures posed a legitimate security threat or represented normal internal user behavior requiring continued monitoring instead of escalation.

Lab Objectives

• Analyze authentication failure alerts generated by Wazuh
• Identify alert escalation thresholds based on frequency and time windows
• Distinguish false positives from true positives using contextual analysis
• Correlate failed and successful authentication events
• Practice SOC-style alert triage and decision-making

Environment Architecture

The lab environment consisted of the following components:

• Wazuh Manager running on Linux
• Windows endpoint with Wazuh agent installed
• Linux endpoint with SSH enabled
• Virtualized lab environment (VirtualBox)

All systems were configured to forward security telemetry to the Wazuh Manager for centralized analysis.

Data Sources Analyzed

• Windows Security Event Logs
• Linux authentication logs (PAM / SSH)
• Wazuh rule-based alerts
• Agent metadata including source IPs and timestamps

Investigation Process

Authentication failure alerts were reviewed in the Wazuh Threat Hunting module. Initial alerts were generated due to repeated failed login attempts originating from an internal IP address. Early analysis indicated low risk due to limited attempts spread over time, classifying the activity as a false positive.

As the volume of failures increased within a shorter time window, Wazuh escalated the alert severity. Correlation with subsequent successful authentication events confirmed suspicious behavior, shifting the assessment to a true positive requiring further monitoring.

Key Findings

• Initial authentication failures were low-risk and internal
• Alert escalation occurred when attempts increased rapidly
• Source IP remained internal, reducing immediate threat severity
• Correlation with successful logins increased risk confidence
• Context and timing were critical in determining alert accuracy

Skills Demonstrated

• SIEM alert triage and investigation
• Authentication failure analysis
• False positive vs true positive classification
• Event correlation and timeline analysis
• Security monitoring using Wazuh

All IP addresses and events shown originate from an isolated home lab environment. No production systems or real user data were involved.
